# MyReads Project

MyReads is an app built with Reactjs to track a users books. A book on the shelf can be in any of these 3 categories:

  1. Want to Read
  2. Currently Reading
  3. Read

The application consists of two pages.
  1. **Home Page** : The Home Page consists of all the books currently in your shelf. Here you can move books between the 3      categories mentioned above or completely take them off your shelf.

  2. **Search Page** : The Search Page consists of a search input where users can type in a search query and books that match the query will be returned. If there are no matching books, an appropriate error message is shown. Users can add search results to their homepage and if the search result is already on the shelf, users can move between shelves or completely take the book off the shelf.
