# MyReads 

MyReads is a project from Udacity's React Nanodegree course.  This app allows you to search through a limited catalog and add books to various shelves.  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 

## Getting Started
Clone the project and install all dependencies by running `npm install`.  Start the development server with `npm start`, the app should be up and running on localhost:3000 


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
