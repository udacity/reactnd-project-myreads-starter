# MyReads Project

This is my entry for the MyReads project. I was very late to get this in because of some major life changes that occurred. I had to get through those first before I could start and the aftermath continued to affect my development time... both in the amount of time and my level of concentration. I am back on track now and excited to move forward.

I am really into design - and a CSS lover - but I did not get to go above and beyond on that level due to being behind in the course. Same goes for features... but I have all kinds of personal projects in the works, so I'm not too concerned about standing out. I'm also not necessarily looking to enter the job market with this nanodegree - not for a while, anwyways, so that is not too concerning at this time.

Thank you for viewing and assessing my project. I worked hard on it.

## Dependencies & Development Info

Bulma (specifically BulmaSwatch's 'Journal' swatch) was used as a CSS framework for this project.

[Journal](https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/journal/)

If I have done my job correctly, you should be able to use everything from the start because even Bulma is 'minified' down to single CSS file output. 

Still, as always... this is how you 

### Getting Started

running `npm install` in the project directory will install required dependencies for the project. 

`npm start` will start the development server, allowing for hot-reloading based on saved file changes.

The backend API [BooksAPI.js](./src/BooksAPI.js) uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms because of the nature of this React app (school project)... the list of usable search terms can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
